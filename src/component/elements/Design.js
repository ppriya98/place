            <h2>KALAKAARI</h2>
            <br />
            <p> This 3000-year-old organic art of hand and block printing was traditionally used for making narrative scrolls and panels. This exquisite folk art has a strong connect with Persian motifs. Kalamkari derives its name from kalam or pen and is a legacy that has been handed down from generation to generation in Andhra Pradesh. The stylised animal forms, floral motifs and mehrab designs predominant in Kalamkari paintings have also found a place in Kalamkari textiles. Kalamkari art primarily involves earthy colours like indigo, green, rust, black and mustard. </p>
